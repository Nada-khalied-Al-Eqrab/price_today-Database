# Price Today System - SQL Database Project

This project focuses on the design and development of a price monitoring system using an SQL database. This system provides a powerful tool for both businesses and consumers, offering accurate and up-to-date information on the prices of various products in the market.

## Project Goals

1.  **Price Data Collection:** Gather product price data from various sources, such as online retailers and physical stores.
2.  **Data Storage:** Store the price data in a structured and easily queryable SQL database.
3.  **Data Analysis:** Analyze the price data to identify trends and price changes over time.
4.  **Report Generation:** Generate periodic reports on product prices, such as average prices, and highest and lowest prices.
5.  **Price Alerts:** Send alerts to users when significant changes occur in the prices of products they are tracking.

## System Components

1.  **SQL Database:**
    *   Tables to store product data: (product name, brand, category, etc.)
    *   Tables to store price data: (price date, product price, store, etc.)
